# Bezier curves

This program allow you to graphically draw basic Bezier's curves for fun

The functions are limited but you can :
  - **add** a new point to make the curve looks more complex
  - **clean** the board
  - **hide** all construction lines
  - **drag** the white points to move the tangents and the others to give a different shape to the curve

## Requirements
You need to have tkinter installed, if not type this in your terminal :
```python3 -m pip install tkinter```
